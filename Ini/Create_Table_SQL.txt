- Create a table with a PrimaryKey field with an AutoNumber data type and a field called MyText with a Text data type and a length of 10, type the following statement in the Data Definition Query window, and then run the query.
	
	CREATE TABLE Table1 (Id COUNTER CONSTRAINT PrimaryKey PRIMARY KEY, MyText TEXT (10)) 

- After you create both tables, running the following query creates a one- to-many relationship between Table1 and Table2, with Table1 as the primary side of the relationship:
	
	ALTER TABLE Table2 ADD CONSTRAINT Relation1 FOREIGN KEY ([Id]) REFERENCES Table1 ([Id])

- Delete the relationship between the tables, run the following query:

	ALTER TABLE Table2 DROP CONSTRAINT Relation1

- Delete Table1, run the following query:

	DROP TABLE Table1

- Delete Table2, run the following query:

	DROP TABLE Table2 

- Alter Column in Table1
	
	ALTER TABLE Table1 ALTER COLUMN [DateSend] DATETIME DEFAULT NOW() NOT NULL

- Add new Column [Field]

	ALTER TABLE Table1 ADD COLUMN Notes TEXT(25)

- Alter Column Data Type and Size

	ALTER TABLE Table1 ALTER COLUMN ZipCode TEXT(10)

- Delete a column in a table, use the following syntax (notice that some database systems don't allow deleting a column):
	ALTER TABLE Table1 DROP COLUMN column_name
